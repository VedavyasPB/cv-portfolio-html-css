# CV / Portfolio Website â€“ HTML & CSS

This project is a **personal CV & portfolio site** built entirely with **HTML and CSS**.  
I created it by looking at a UI design mockup and coding the layout and styles from scratch, without using any frameworks or templates.

## ðŸ”¹ What I Practiced
- Converting a static **UI design into code**  
- Writing **semantic HTML5** structure  
- Using **CSS3 for layout, typography, and responsive design**  
- Organizing content into sections: Hero, Skills, Blog, Events, and Footer
